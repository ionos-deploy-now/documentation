## Fork & deploy

### Setup

Install dependencies and edit the new `.env` file.

npm ci
cp .env.example .env
```

:warning: If .env is missing errors like `Error: Cannot query field "teaser" on type "MarkdownPage".` appear.


### Develop

Run local server.

```bash
npm run develop
```

### Content

All content resides in the `content` directory, where the next directory name decides the `contentType`.
Pages can be created manually or generated with the cli.

```bash
npm run cli
```

### Build

Create static build in `dist` folder.

```bash
npm run build
```
