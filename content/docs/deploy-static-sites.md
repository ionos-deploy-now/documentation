# Deploy Static Sites via GitHub

Deploy Now offers automated builds and deployments to a shared hosting infrastructure for any static sites, such as Static Site Generation projects, Single Page Applications or plain HTML/CSS websites. They can be set up as a `starter project` that comes with your Deploy Now plan or as an `static project` for more storage and staging environments.

## Supported frameworks
Deploy Now supports all static sites that can be build with Node.js, Composer, Ruby or any other [language supported by GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-language-support). The following frameworks can be detected automatically to prefill required build dependencies and commands. Please note that we do not provide Node.js runtime environments. 

### Static Site Generators

Hugo, Gatsby, Gridsome, Docusaurus, Vuepress, Vitepress, NuxtJS (static), NextJS (static), Hexo, Metalsmith, 11ty, UmiJS, Astro, Scully, ElderJS, Middleman, Jekyll, Nanoc, Pelican, mkdocs, Jigsaw and Sculpin

### Single Page Applications

Angular, React, Vue, Ionic, Svelte and Ember

## Setup

Simply connect your repository and follow a guided setup of build dependencies and steps. After the setup, your project gets deployed instantly and will build and deploy on every following `git push`. You might want to [create a new project on the command line](/docs/from-cmd-line/), [deploy an existing repository](/docs/from-repo/) or [deploy one of our samples](/docs/framework-samples) for a quickstart. 

## Settings

### Build dependencies, commands and environment variables
Build settings can be adapted directly in the configuration files of the GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows`. Instructions can be found under [build configuration](/docs/github-actions-customization/).

### Domains & TLS
You can connect any kind of custom domain in a few clicks. If you want to connect a domain that you have not purchased at IONOS, you need to switch to the IONOS nameservers first. Each domain is automatically SSL secured.

### Redirects, rewrites, HTACCESS
Redirects and rewrites can be managed via `.htaccess` files. Visit [Apache configuration](/docs/apache-configuration-htaccess) for examples.
