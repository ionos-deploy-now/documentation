# Introduction


Deploy Now is a hosting platform that allows you to deploy static sites and PHP apps directly via GitHub. As a tool built from developers for developers, Deploy Now automates build and deployment so you can focus entirely on your code. Your code is deployed to [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/) reliable shared hosting infrastructure in Europe and North America. The workflow automation is based on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and can be customized directly in your repository.
