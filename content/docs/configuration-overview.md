# Overview

Deploy Now is web hosting right away from [GitHub](https://github.com/) to [IONOS](https://ionos.com). Automation is based on [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as continous intergration and continous delivery/deployment (CI/CD) workflow. Starting a new project with Deploy Now generates a GitHub Action workflow file out of the box and makes CI/CD a breeze.

But Deploy Now isn't able to guess all available settings and sometimes it makes sense to simply start your configuration from scratch. In both cases this is the right beginning to read further.

**TODO** - add a big picture and a workfow explanation
